# Networks

    A computer network is a set of computers sharing resources located on or provided by network nodes. 
    The computers use common communication protocols  
    over digital interconnections to communicate with each other. 
    These interconnections are made up of telecommunication network technologies, based on  
    physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies.

     The currency of real networking is not greed but generosity


# Check_Sum

    
    This is a block code method where a checksum is created based on the data values in 
    the data blocks to be transmitted using some
    algorithm and appended to the data. When the receiver gets this data, a new checksum 
    is calculated and compared with the existing checksum. 
    A non-match indicates an error.

# leaky bucket 

    The leaky bucket is an algorithm based on an analogy of how a bucket with a 
    constant leak will overflow if either the average 
    rate at which water is poured in exceeds the rate at which the 
    bucket leaks or if more water than the capacity of the bucket 
    is poured in all at once
